# Requirements

- [x] Homepage with all the characters and the first five deaths fetched from the API
- [x] Seasons page with all the seasons and their respective episodes fetched from the API
- [ ] Filter for characters based on their names, birthday and portrayed

# Bugs

Probably not a bug, but there is small delay when loading all the characters, this could be solved by implementing lazy loading in the 
character component so we only load characters as the user scrolls down, this also could result in a better performance

# To Do 

- Filter component based on the character's name, birthday and portrayed
- Search component based on keyowords
- Implement lazy loading for critical components in the app, that could also improve the performance
- Implementation of better state management, Redux would be helpful

# Extra credits

- Infinite scroll
